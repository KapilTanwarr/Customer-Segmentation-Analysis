# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
Overview
Customer segmentation is a vital marketing strategy that divides customers into distinct groups based on similar characteristics such as demographics, behavior, or purchasing patterns. 
It helps businesses better understand their customers, allowing for more personalized marketing strategies, improved customer satisfaction, and increased sales.

In this project,
we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation. Specifically, we use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to categorize customers based on their purchase behavior and demographic data.

# Methodology
The project follows these steps:

# Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data (if any).
Normalization/standardization of data for effective clustering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing the distributions of customer demographics.
Analyzing customer spending behavior.
K-Means Clustering:

Applying the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Using K-Means clustering to segment customers.
Visualization of Clusters:

Plotting clusters to understand customer segments.
Customer Profiling:

Analyzing each cluster to derive actionable insights about different customer groups.

# Results
Based on the K-Means clustering analysis, the customers were segmented into distinct groups that represent different behaviors, such as:

Low-income, low-spending customers.
High-income, high-spending customers.
Moderate-income, average-spending customers.
These insights can help businesses focus their marketing efforts on high-value customers and retain those with growth potential.

# Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and machine learning.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing K-Means clustering.

# Conclusion
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique for improving customer satisfaction and boosting revenue through personalized marketing strategies. 
The K-Means clustering algorithm provided a clear way to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

# The clusters generated can be used for:

Targeted marketing campaigns.
Customer retention strategies.
Product recommendations.
